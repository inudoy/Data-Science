## Data Science Task Catagories
### Data Management:
1.Mysql:Popular open source relational data base works on query language (https://www.mysql.com/)<br>
2.PostgreSql:It is also a relational Database(https://www.postgresql.org/)<br>
3.Mongodb:It is a non-relational data base (https://www.mongodb.com/)<br>
4.Apache Casendra :  Cassandra is an open-source NoSQL data storage system that leverages a distributed architecture to enable high availability and reliability.(https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html)<br>
5.HADDOP : HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) is the primary storage system used by Hadoop applications. This open source framework works by rapidly transferring data between nodes. It's often used by companies who need to handle and store big data.(https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html)<br>
